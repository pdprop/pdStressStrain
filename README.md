# pdStressStrain
Repository for programs to simulate cyclic stress-strain  and fatigue behavior
The programs in pdStressStrain simulate the cyclic deformation
behavior of a axial metal specimen subjected to variable amplitude
strain histories.  In this first example the deformation of a steel tube wound onto
a reel on a ship and then unwound into the sea to enable work on an
off-shore oil or gas well is simulated.  Cyclic stress-strain hysteresis loops
are computed and displayed graphically for various service events.
Fatigue damage due to the cyclic loading or straining of the tube is 
also calculated.
